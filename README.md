# NDsim
Norsk Data emulator Windows version only
This is an emulator of the ND-10/110/110/120 mini computers. Its is
currently running on Windows 10 (maybe also XP and higher).
It will run programs developed for the Norsk Data SINTRAN-III
operating system, but limited to background programs. A number
of the system calls (MON xx) are emulated to be able to read/write
files etc.
The ZIP file contains the emulator .exe and a number of folders
for the users SYSTEM, RT etc. User SYSTEM contains programs for
editing, compiling and linking.
Unpack the zipped file, double click the .exe file and the emulator
prompt <> should be displayed. Typing e.g. FORT should now start
the Fortran compiler.
The folder Doc contains a user manual for the emulator program.
